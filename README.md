# Clicker
I've decided I want to build a basic ever-growing Clicker browser game, to keep track of various facets I've learned during the School of Code bootcamp.

I aim to add different functionality at certain levels reached, building on previous points reached. There will also be an option to reset the counter to Zero and lose all progress, as well as the ability to save progress locally for later.

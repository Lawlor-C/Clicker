# Clicker
I've decided I want to build a basic ever-growing Clicker browser game, to keep track of various facets I've learned during the School of Code bootcamp.

I aim to add different functionality at certain levels reached, building on previous points reached. There will also be an option to reset the counter to Zero and lose all progress, as well as the ability to save progress locally for later.

Having spent the last couple of weeks learning to code in React, I'm considering fleshing this version out a little more to get some personality into it, but then recreate and develop it further in a React environment. Think it'll actually be far easier to keep track of this type of project in React component tree...
